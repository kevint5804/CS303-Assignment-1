INSTRUCTIONS
Running this program will prompt the user to input a text file. Enter "input.txt" to begin loading the file and see how many integers are in the array.
For all prompts, make sure all values are integers. Enter a value between 1-100, and the user will be given the index of the value.
After that, enter an index and a new value to replace the original value at that index. The user will be given the original value and the new value of the index.
Next, enter a value to add to the end of the array: the array size will be updated when this happens.
Finally, enter an index number to remove the value at the given index. The array size will be updated again and will shift any integers to the right of that index to the left by 1.
